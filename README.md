#FrozenBones
##A WordPress Development Theme

####Introduction 

FrozenBones is a look into the foundations of WordPress development theming. 
Developed by [PxO Ink](http://pxoink.net/) and based on 
[Bones](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones) by 
[Eddie Machado](http://themble.com/bones), this theme is designed to provide 
a comprehensive platform while maintaining a simplistic, "bare-bones," product. 

####Methodology

FrozenBones pushes a legacy view of highly targeted and specific inheritence 
of cascading design principles. While it has become unavoidable to deprecate 
support for ancient HTML and CSS interpretation, it's also important to 
understand where modern design methods have originated from. When using 
this platform to build a proper theme, you may find that a more modern 
implementation of fluid or accessible design is required. Many of the 
existing functionalities can be applied with any design and should not 
require extensive modification, if any. 

####Collaboration

This is not a production build. That is to say, FrozenBones is designed to 
be used as a basis for your own imaginative, unique, and inspiring creations. 
If you stumble upon any discoveries, identify any problems, or make progress 
toward any solutions, please be kind and pay that knowledge forward so other 
developers can learn from you.

FrozenBones is currently being supported as of February 2014.
