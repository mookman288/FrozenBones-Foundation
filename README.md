#FrozenBones
##A WordPress Development Theme

####Introduction 

FrozenBones is a look into the foundations of WordPress development theming. Developed by [PxO Ink](http://pxoink.net/) and based on [Bones](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones) by [Eddie Machado](http://themble.com/bones) and [_s](https://github.com/automattic/_s), this theme is designed to provide a comprehensive platform while maintaining a simplistic, "bare-bones," product. 

####Methodology

FrozenBones is designed to target developers looking for a near-complete bare-bones experience. With a foundation in **Bones** and **_s**, the inherent theme support is high. The only "restrictions" on developers are on distribution assets. CSS files should be placed in `/css`, JS files in `/js`, and images be placed in `/images`. 

####Collaboration

Fork and expand your version of FrozenBones. If there's an issue, or modernization that you want to see in the core deliverable, feel free to open an issue. 

FrozenBones is currently being supported as of April 2017.
